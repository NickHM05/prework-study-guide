# Prework Study Guide Webpage <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My prework study guide was made for the prework section of the bootcamp but may serve as more study guide material for the rest of the bootcamp. The work that was done was a good introduction to the bootcamp. 

-my motivation for completing the bootcamp is to open myself to more career oppurtunities in the modern tech field so that hopefully I can provide for my family more in the future. I really do appreciate this bootcamp as an oppurtunity to work in the job field using more of my mind instead of using just my body.
-I built this project so that i can have a better baseline understanding of programming in the beginning by creating a webpage and supporting applications of code and such.
-Problems i solved were some such as debugging my code in javascript to properly implement the interactions i wanted available in my webpage, I changed the look of my webpage so it looks more detailed than the original, and I learned the proper flow to implement my code that way it works properly.
-It introduced me to working with and understanding concepts in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. I learned how to use them together to create my webpage for the prework but that gave me the life experience to create something similar on my own if i wanted to.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?>

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## "N/A" <Installation>

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

This prework study guide covers the list of topics such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript which is found using inspect on the webpage pulled from the browser using the code we made in VS Code. The other topic covered is Git as well.

<Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)>

## "N/A" <Credits>

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

Please refer to the license in the REPO

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges
These are the notes first held when creating this section of code and may be useful later
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
